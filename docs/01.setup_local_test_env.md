# Setup local test env: Setup a K3S Server and an Agent using VirtualBox
- ## Prerequisits
   1. VirtualBox
   1. Ubuntu Server ISO image and Raspbian Buster ISO image
   1. Recommended minimum Hardware Capacity:
      + 4 Cores of CPU
      + 8 GB onboard memory
      + 20 GB onboard SSD storage
- ## Setup VMs
   1. Create a host-only network in VirtualBox, with DHCP
   1. Setup a Ubuntu Server and a Raspbian using VirtualBox on your laptop, with SSH
      + Assign a NAT adaptor for each VM
      + Assign a bridged network adapter using that previously created host-only network, for each VM 
   1. Setup SSH trust between laptop and VMs
      + SSH to the VM from laptop using the VM's account and password
      + Append the public key of laptop (usually at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to VM's file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
         - Deploy SSH services (usually `OpenSSH`) on your laptop and these VMs, if they are not installed yet
         - Run `ssh-keygen` in Command Window to create the public and private keys for your laptop and each VM, if they do not have a key yet
- ## Setup K3S Server and Agent [(reference)](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/advanced/#running-k3d-k3s-in-docker-and-docker-compose)
   1. Deploy K3S Server on Ubuntu Server
      + Deploy Docker using command: 
      ```
      curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh -
      ```
      + Let Docker run in user mod using command: 
      ```
      sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
      ```
      + Deploy K3S server with an explicit IP address, to avoid using the NAT address: 
      ```
      curl -L https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker â€”node-external-ip <external IP address>
      ```
         - external IP address: use the IP Address of the Host-Only network created previously
      + Check K3S service status:
      ```
      sudo systemctl status k3s
      ```
   1. Deploy K3S Agent on Raspbian
      + Deploy Docker using:
       ```
       sudo apt install docker.io
       sudo usermod -aG docker `whoami`
       ```
      + Deploy K3S agent:
      ```
      curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<myserver external IP address>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<mynodetoken> sh -
      ```
      + Check Agent status:
      ```
      sudo systemctl status k3s-agent
      tail -f /var/log/daemon.log
      ```
   1. Setup K3S Dashboard according to [reference](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/kube-dashboard/), but with exceptions:
      +  for remote access, start a proxy on all interfaces and accept all hosts, such as:
      ```
      sudo k3s kubectl proxy --accept-hosts '^.*$' --address '0.0.0.0'
      ```
      + Kubernetes dashboard does not allow remote access using an address other than `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. to solve this:
         + setup a ssh link on your laptop:
         ```
         ssh -L <local port>:127.0.0.1:8001 -N <username>@<kubernetes-dashboard-host>
         ```
         + for example using `9999` as local port:
         ```
         ssh -L 9999:127.0.0.1:8001 -N rin@192.168.57.5
         ```
         + access the dashboard using the link:
         ```
         http://localhost:9999/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/login
         ```
